 Fibinoacci Series
 --------------------
    Is a sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting 
    from 0 and 1, for n > 1, where n is the user input.

    The script FibinoacciSeries.py prints the Fibinoacci series, where the count of digits 
    is equal to the user input which is of data type int.
    
        Input : Total number of integer values the series should contain.
        Output: A series of number where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
        starting from 0 and 1 to count (input_value)

    How to execute the script on terminal
        1. cd to path where the script is saved.
        2. execute "python3 FibinoacciSeries.py <--i> 5"


Palindrome Finder
----------------------
    A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the 
    same backward as forward. 
        eg. Madam, I'm Adam

    The script Palindrome.py find whether the user given input can be a palindrome or not.

        Input : A string input from user
        Output: Returns True/False based on whether the input is palindrome or not

    How to execute the script on terminal
